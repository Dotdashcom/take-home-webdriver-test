<br>

## Help
For help on using the run command, please refer to the _run_ command help
```
./run -h
```

## Installing
After installing and configuring the above pre-requisites, type the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/jpsugg/take-home-webdriver-test.git
chmod +x run
./run
```
_Note: the __run__ command pulls the docker images and configures the docker network automatically._
<br>

## Running
* Tests locally,

        ./run
* Tests against a remote Selenium Grid,

        ./run -r 

## Running faster
* Tests locally; spawns 4 threads in parallel,

        ./run -T 4
* Tests against a remote Selenium Grid; spawns 3 chrome-nodes in parallel with 3 max. concurrent sessions each,

        ./run -r -T 2
  
_Note: all the above commands, start and stop the Webapp and the Selenium Grid automatically._
_Note2: The amount of chrome nodes that will successfully run your tests will depend on your machine. On my machine, running more than 4 nodes may turn tests unstable._
<br>

## Stopping / Starting
* To manually start/stop the Webapp and Selenium Grid, without running the test suite:

        ./run -G start         # Initializes a Selenium Grid with 1 Chrome node
        ./run -G start -T 7    # Initializes a Selenium Grid with 7 Chrome nodes
        ./run -G stop          # Terminates the Grid
