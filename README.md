# Wha is this repo for?

This repository is demonstration on how to interact with most basic web elements and technique in Selenium with Java.
The original challenge was from: https://github.com/Dotdashcom/take-home-webdriver-test

You can use Docker like the instruction or use this page directly for testing:
https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/

# Environment
* Maven is installed

# Run test
```mvn test```

# Webdriver Tests
## Prerequisites
  * Docker
  + Git
  - Java
  * Webdriver
  + ChromeDriver
  * IDE such as IntelliJ

## Steps
1. Pull Docker image for the-internet app:
  
    `docker pull gprestes/the-internet`
  
2. Run the following command: 

    `docker run -d -p 7080:5000 gprestes/the-internet`
  
3. Set the following BaseUrl for your tests:

   `http://localhost:7080`
   
4. Use ChromeDriver to write Tests for the following scenarios in Java:
    * Login Success: http://localhost:7080/login credentials: tomsmith/SuperSecretPassword!
    + Login Failure: http://localhost:7080/login Login fail invalid creadentials
    - CheckBoxes: http://localhost:7080/checkboxes Check and uncheck boxes
    * ContextMenu: http://localhost:7080/context_menu Right-click in the box to see one called 'the-internet'. Test JavaScript alert text on Right-Click.
    + Drag and Drop: http://localhost:7080/drag_and_drop Perofrm Drag And Drop in a Webdriver test.
    - Dropdown: http://localhost:7080/dropdown Test dropdown using Webdriver.
    * Dynamic Content: http://localhost:7080/dynamic_content Test content changes with page reload.
    + Dynamic Controls: http://localhost:7080/dynamic_controls Test Dynamic Controls using Explicit Waits.
    - Dynamic Loading: http://localhost:7080/dynamic_loading/2 Test Dynamic Loading using Explict Waits.
    * File Download: http://localhost:7080/download Test File Download.

    * Iframe: http://localhost:7080/iframe Test iframe.
    + Mouse Hover: http://localhost:7080/hovers Test Mouse Hover.
    - JavaScript Alerts: http://localhost:7080/javascript_alerts Test confirm JS Alert.
    * JavaScript Error: http://localhost:7080/javascript_error Test JS error.
    + Open in New Tab: http://localhost:7080/windows Test Link Opens in new tab.
    - Notification Message: http://localhost:7080/notification_message_rendered Test notification Message.
  
5. Open a Pull Request for Code Review.
