Hi, my name is Abdullah Taqi. This is my submission for the QA excercise. 
I was having trouble running the tests from the pom.xml file as well as from the testngfile because the tests would start up but nothing would happen.
As a work around I added a AllTests.java file which when run executes all the tests with out a problem.
Any feedback to help me improve if appreaciated.
Thank you for this oppurtunty
