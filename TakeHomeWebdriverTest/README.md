Hi, my name is Abdullah Taqi. This is my submission for the QA excercise. 
I was having trouble running the tests from the pom.xml file as well as from the testng.xml file because the tests would start up but nothing would happen.
As a work around I added a AllTests.java file under src/main/java/tests which when run executes all the tests without a problem.
Any feedback to help me improve is appreaciated.
Thank you for this oppurtunity
